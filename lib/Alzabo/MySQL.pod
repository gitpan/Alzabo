=head1 NAME

Alzabo and MySQL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation is about what special support Alzabo has for MySQL,
as well as what is lacking.

MySQL support is based on the 3.23.* release series, with some support
for features that are starting to appear in the 4.0.* releases.
Earlier versions of MySQL will probably work with Alzabo, though
Alzabo cannot magically make these releases support new features like
fulltext indexes.

=head2 Indexes

=over 4

=item *

Alzabo supports the ability to specify prefixes when adding an index.
Prefixes are required when attempting to index any sort of text or
blob column.

=item *

Alzabo supports the creation of fulltext indexes and their use in
SELECT and WHERE clauses.  This includes the ability to get back the
score given for a match as part of a select, using the C<function> or
C<select> methods of either table or schema objects.

=head2 Reverse Engineering

=over 4

=item *

When reverse engineering a schema, Alzabo knows that MySQL has
"default defaults" for certain column types.  For example, if a DATE
column is specified as NOT NULL but is not assigned a default, MySQL
gives this column a default of '0000-00-00'.

Because Alzabo knows about this, it will ignore these defaults when
reverse engineering an RDBMS.

=item *

Similarly, Alzabo knows that MySQL assigns defaults "lengths" to many
column types.  For example, if given INTEGER as a column type, MySQL
will convert this to INTEGER(11) or INTEGER(10), depending on the
version of MySQL being used.

Again, Alzabo ignores these lengths when reverse engineering a schema.

=back

=head2 Transactions

=over 4

Alzabo will try to use transactions whenever appropriate.
Unfortunately, there is no way to determine whether or not a given
table supports transactions so Alzabo simply sets AutoCommit to 0,
whether or not this will actually do anything.

=back

=head2 Constraints and Foreign Keys

=over 4

=item *

Column constraints are treated as column attributes.

=item *

Foreign key constraints are not generated when generating SQL for a
Postgres schema.  This will probably change in the future.

=back

=head2 Table Types

=over 4

As of now, there is no way to specify table specific attributes with
Alzabo.
