=head1 FAQ

=head2 I installed the Mason components but I get errors about being unable to find a component (particularly /alzabo/common/href)

There are lots of different things to check.  When Alzabo asked you
what absolute path to use for component calls from within a component,
you may have given wrong answer.

If your component root is the same as your document root, then the
answer should simply be the path to the subdirectory where you
installed the components for Alzabo.

If your component root is under your document root, then things are a
bit more complicated.  Here is an example:

 Server's document root:  /usr/local/apache/htdocs
 Mason component root:    /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mason
 Alzabo components:       /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mason/apps/alzabo

In this case, the answer to the path question is '/apps'.  A component
located in C</usr/local/apache/htdocs/mason/apps> would use the
absolute path C</apps> to call another component in the same
directory.  However, an external call (via a web client) to components
in that directory would start with C</mason/apps>.

If this doesn't solve your problem please see the Mason HQ page, at
http://www.masonhq.com/.  Make sure to read the Introduction and
Administrator's Manual in the Documentation section.

=head2 How can I generate the SQL to turn one schema into another?

Assuming you have schema objects representing these already created
(through reverse engineering for example) B<and> both schemas are for
the same RDBMS, you can simply do this:

 my @sql = $schema1->rules->schema_diff( old => $schema1, new => $schema2 );

The C<@sql> array will contain all the SQL statements necessary to
transform the schema in C<$schema1> into the schema in C<$schema2>.

=head2 How can I make a local copy of the documentation as HTML?

Alzabo comes with a script called C<make_html_docs.pl>.  It takes
three arguments.  The first is the source file directory root.  The
second is the target directory.  The last is the absolute URL path
that this target directory represents.  If you have perl 5.6.0
installed, it is recommended that you use it to run this script as the
Pod::Html module included with 5.6.0 does a much better job of making
HTML.

If you were in the root of the source directory you might run this as:

 perl ./lib /usr/local/apache/htdocs/Alzabo_docs /Alzabo_docs

The script will create an index.html file as well as turning the
documentation into HTML.
