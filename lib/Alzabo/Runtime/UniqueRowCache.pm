=head1 NAME

Alzabo::Runtime::UniqueRowCache - Implements a row cache for Alzabo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Alzabo::Runtime::UniqueRowCache;

  Alzabo::Runtime::UniqueRowCache->clear();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple caching mechanism for C<Alzabo::Runtime::Row>
objects that tries to ensure that for there is never more than one row
object in memory for a given database row.

To use it, simply load it.

It can be foiled through the use of C<Storable> or other "deep magic"
cloning code, like in the C<Clone> module.

The cache is a simple hash kept in memory.  If you use this module,
you are responsible for clearing the cache as needed.  The only time
it is cleared automatically is when a table update or delete is
performed, in which case all cached rows for that table are cleared.

In a persistent environment like mod_perl, you should clear the cache
on a regular basis in order to prevent the cache from getting out of
sync with the database.  A good way to do this is to clear it at the
start of every request.

=head1 METHODS

All methods provided are class methods.

=over 4

=item * clear

This clears the entire cache

=item * clear_table( $table_object )

Given a table object, this method clear all the rows associated with
that table.

=item * row_in_cache( $table_name, $row_id )

Given a table I<name> and a row id, as returned by the C<<
Alzabo::Runtime::Row->id_as_string >> method, this method returns the
matching row from the cache, if it exists.  Otherwise it returns undef.

=item * delete_from_cache( $table_name, $row_id )

Given a table I<name> and a row id, as returned by the C<<
Alzabo::Runtime::Row->id_as_string >> method, this method returns the
matching row from the cache.

=item * write_to_cache( $row_object )

Given a row object, this method stores it in the cache.

=back

=head1 AVOIDING THE CACHE

If you want to not cache a row, then you can pass the "no_cache"
parameter to any table or schema method that creates a new row object.
