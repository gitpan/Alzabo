The Exception::Class module that Alzabo uses does not like Perl 5.6.0
(specifically, the Devel::StackTrace module used by Exception::Class
doesn't).  This is due to bugs in Perl 5.6.0.  If you don't turn on
debugging mode then this shouldn't be a problem.

Installing Alzabo:

 perl Makefile.PL
 (answer the questions you're asked)
 make test
 make install

To use the Mason based schema creator, you must load the
Alzabo::Create modules.  To do this, add the following line to your
startup.pl (or mason_handler.pl or whatever) file:

 use Alzabo::Create;

Adding a PerlModule line in your httpd.conf or a <Perl> section that
uses the module would work just as well.

For the Mason based data browser, you'll also need to load the
Alzabo::Runtime classes.
