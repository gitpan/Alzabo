NOTE: This code uses Michael Schwern's excellent Class::Fields
package, which comes with a number of modules.  Two of these modules,
base.pm and fields.pm, have the same names as existing Perl packages
that come with the core Perl installation.  It is recommended that you
install these over your existing base.pm and fields.pm if you want to
use this package as this guarantees that some of the code in Alzabo
will work for Perl 5.00503, 5.6 and most likely for future versions as
well.  For 5.00503 and 5.6, the exisitng base.pm will most likely
work, though either the Class::Fields or 5.6 version of fields.pm are
required.  It's probably just best to use the Class::Fields version,
which is better anyway.

To make sure you have the Class::Fields version, make sure
Class::Fields is installed with the following command:

  make install UNINST=1


Also, the Exception::Class module that Alzabo uses does not like Perl
5.6 (specifically, the Devel::StackTrace module doesn't).  This is due
to bugs in Perl 5.6.  If you don't turn on debugging mode then this
shouldn't be a problem.

Installing Alzabo:

perl Makefile.PL
(answer the questions you're asked)
make test
make install


To use the Mason based schema creator, you must load the
Alzabo::Create modules.  To do this, add the following line to your
startup.pl (or mason_handler.pl or whatever) file:

use Alzabo::Create;

Adding a PerlModule line in your httpd.conf or a <Perl> section that
uses the module would work just as well.

For the Mason based data browser, you'll also need to load the
Alzabo::Runtime classes.
