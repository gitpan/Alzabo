Known Bugs

- When running tests with Postgres, there are intermittent test
failures along the lines of "source database "template1" is being
accessed by other users".  I've tried working around this by forking
like crazy during the test suite, and that seems to have mostly fixed
it.  But I still see this from time to time.
