Known Bugs

- When running tests with Postgres, there are intermittent test
failures along the lines of "source database "template1" is being
accessed by other users".  I've tried working around this by forking
like crazy during the test suite, and that seems to have mostly fixed
it.  But I still see this from time to time.

- Reverse engineer of a Pg schema doesn't catch SERIAL columns, cause
they're reported as int4 with a special default.  Maybe just check for
that default?
