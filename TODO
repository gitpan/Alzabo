Short term:

- make it possible to have a multi-column foreign key

- Centralize caching into Alzabo::ObjectCache and make it take options
  on a storage mechanism (memory, file, etc) and a locking method
  (ipc, file, dbm, etc).  This is similar to how Apache::Session works.

- After conversion, make local $table->{prefetch} work (tied scalar).

- save objects to disk in something a bit more robust than a
  serialized object form.  Probably this will be some sort of XML.

- write up a comparison to other similar modules/tools.  Class::DBI,
  DbFramework, Bingo::CarbonX, DBIx::RecordSet, Tangram.

- non-Mason interface (curses, plain CGI)

- expand regression tests for core API

Medium term:

- expand data browser to be configurable between sessions (for
  example, to use textarea fields for certain things)

- Help text for all interfaces (some of it should be shared since the
  basic ideas are the same)

- More drivers & rules (Oracle, Sybase, Interbase, Solid, and so on)

Long term:

- GUI (preferably both UNIX & Win32 so Tk?)
