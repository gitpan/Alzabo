Short term:

- Alzabo::ObjectCache::DBIStore - this module will also do syncing all
  in one.  This will allow the caching/syncing to occur across
  multiple machines with multiple processes.

- Make multiple row classes (one for caching and for non-caching).
Maybe also create null row class (always return undef).

- expand regression tests for core API - SQLMaker, RDBMSRules,
MethodMaker, Runtime;:Table->set_group

- After conversion, make local $table->{prefetch} work (tied scalar).
  I'm no longer sure this is possible.  My most recent attempt caused
  inexplicable test failures.

- Give the options to save objects to disk in something a bit more
  robust than a serialized object form.  Barrie Slaymaker is working
  on a generic XML language for database schema modelling, to be
  called DBML.

- non-Mason interface (curses, plain CGI)

- make caching system more atomic.  I'm sure there are subtle race
conditions in there that should be fixed (timestamps are generated
more than once, which could be a problem, for one).

Medium term:

- support any and all SQL, of arbitrary complexity.

- rewrite data browser to not suck so much

- expand data browser to be configurable between sessions (for
  example, to use textarea fields for certain things)

- Help text for all interfaces (some of it should be shared since the
  basic ideas are the same)

- More drivers & rules (Oracle, Sybase, Interbase, Solid, and so on)

Long term:

- GUI (preferably both UNIX & Win32 so Tk?)
