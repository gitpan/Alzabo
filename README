Alzabo is a two-fold program. Its first function is as a data
modelling tool. Through either a schema creation interface or a custom
perl program, you can create a set of schema, table, column,
etc. objects that represent your data model. Alzabo is also capable of
reverse engineering an existing data model.

Its second function is as a RDBMS to object mapping system. Once you
have created a schema, you can use the Alzabo::Runtime::Table and
Alzabo::Runtime::Row classes to access its data. These classes offer a
low level interface to common operations such as SQL SELECT, INSERT,
DELETE, and UPDATE commands.

To take it a step further, you could then aggregate a set of rows from
different tables into a larger container object which could understand
the logical relationship between these tables.  The
Alzabo::MethodMaker module can be very helpful.
